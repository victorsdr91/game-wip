# GAME WIP
This is a project to learn how to make videogames with typescript and excaliburJS. The purpose is to create a kind of mmo phantasy game with a backend layer managing the socket server. 

### In the frontend, the technologies to be used are the following:
1. ReactJS for the UI
2. ExcaliburJS as game engine
3. Tiled for drawing the map
4. SockJS to manage the conection with the BackEnd

### For the backend the proposed technologies are the following:
1. MySQL Database for storing the data
2. Java 11
3. Framework to manage socket server: TBD (Stomp/Socket)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository into your local dev
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the local server
5. Have fun!
